Cycle Monitor Example Apama Application, v1.0 (July 2015)
=========================================================

1.Introduction
--------------
The Cyle Monitor application is an example application built using the Software AG
Apama product. It is intended to exemplify a typical Apama application, in a very 
simplified manner. It is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence and as such 
is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty, without 
even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.


2.Dependencies
--------------
The following dependencies are required to build and run the example application;

Apama: 
The application was built using Software AG Apama, version 5.3. The application
should run on earlier versions of the platform, although please note that PySys
is only shipped with Apama versions 5.1 and later. For more details on Apama see
https://www.softwareag.com/corporate/products/az/apama/default.asp.

PySys: 
PySys is used to demonstrate testing of the application, and is included in the 
Apama distribution post Apama 5.1. Should you have an earlier version of Apama, 
PySys and it's dependencies are detailed on the SourceForge website. For more 
information see http://sourceforge.net/projects/pysys/files/pysys/0.9.2.

Jython:
JyThon 2.7.0 is used to script usage of the Apama Engine Client libraries, in 
particular the scenario service to log changes in dataview instances. This is a 
common approach used where Java libraries are wrapped and scripted within testing. 
Jython should be installed on the local machine, and its location referenced in the 
.pysysproject file. For more details see http://www.jython.org/downloads.html. 

Sqlite:
Sqlite 3.8.10 is used in the testing of the application to create local database 
tables that can be populated within the confines of each test. Sqlite can also be
used as the main database instance to use, should you not have other RDBMS systems
available. For more details see https://sqlite.org/download.html.

MySQL Community Server:
MySQL 5.6 is used as the RDBMS to store configuration data for the application, 
although this is an optional dependency as any RDBMS can be used via the Apama 
ADBC adapter. For more information see http://dev.mysql.com/downloads.
